LARGE MARGIN CLASSIFICATION
If y=1, we want thetatrans*x >> 0 and vice versa
Support vector machine: replace the log terms with cost functions that are just straightened out graphs where the line is flat at 0 before -1 and after1
minC summ y^i * cost (thetatrans*x^i) + (1-y^i)*cost(thetatrans*x^i) + 1/2 * sumn(thetaj^2)
  C=1/lambda
